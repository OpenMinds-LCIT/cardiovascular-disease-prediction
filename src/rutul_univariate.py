"""Here we are doing univariate analysis on different columns of our data set Using:
1. We calculate mean, median, mode of the data.
2. we calculate the frequency of the data.
3. Then we visualise using Box plot and different graph,
   *box plot: there are 4 parts -
    1) Min/Max Point,
    2) Quartiles(Q1=25% Data and Q3=75%Data)
    3) Median Q2
    4) Outliers
