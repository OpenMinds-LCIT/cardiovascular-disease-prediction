# Week 2 Progress Report

*   TASK PREFERENCES AND ASSIGNMENT
*   RENAMED DATA COLUMNS APPROPRIATELY
*   INDIVIDUAL DATA CLEANING FOR EACH COLUMN IN THE DATASET
    *   Transformed `age` column from days to years; Visualized data with pie chart for age groups; Generated Table for frequency and descriptive statistics
    *   Removed Negative and Out of Range Values from `bp_high` column; Visualized Frequency Distribution using Histogram; Visualized Percentage of Variable Distributions
    *   Removed improper data from `weight` column; Visualized Weight Distribution and Frequency; Defined distribution-wise Correlation with Target variable `cardio` using pandas
    *   Import pandas on Python to do my data cleaning, derived `diabetic` column from `chol` and `gluco` column; Co-related `diabetic`, `chol` and `gluco`; Generated Heatmap for co-relation
    *   Gone through the alcohol intake `alco` column and checked for missing values and checked if there were only binary values; Plotted frequency of intake vs none using matplotlib
    *   Removed improper data from the `height` column; Visualized Height Distribution and Frequency; Made Pivot Table for Frequency
    *   Removed out-of-range values from `bp_lo` column; Found Descriptive Stats; Pictured Histogram for visualizing frequencies
    *   Found count of categories in `gender` column; Visualized Percentages of each gender using Pie Chart
    *   Calculated a count of each category in the `smoke` column. Visualized percentages of each category
    *   Found the count of categories in the `physical_activity` column. Visualize them in percentages in a pie chart and represent them using a bar graph.
*   DESCRIBED DATA STATISTICALLY
*   DISCUSSED THE PROJECT TIMELINE
*   DISCUSSED PANDAS LIBRARY
*   GROUPED CLEAN COLUMNS IN A NEW DATASET
*   PREPARED SLIDES FROM CLEANED DATA AND CHARTS FOR PRESENTATION
*   DOCUMENTED PROJECT REPORT AND WEEKLY TASKS
