# WEEK 5 PROGRESS REPORT

- DISCUSSED WEEKLY WORKFLOW ALIGNING PROJECT TIMELINE
- DATA EXPLORATION AND CO-RELATION

  - Described `bp_high` column; Correlated bp_high column with cardio and bp_low using heatmap
  - Data Description of `weight` column and correlate it with cardio using heatmap
  - Define correlation between smoke and `alco` column using heatmap with target variable "cardio" along with Data Description
  - Add helper files, a split dataset using the sci-kit learn library into the test and train dataset
  - Removed improper data from the `height` column; Visualized Height Distribution and Frequency; Made Pivot Table for Frequency
  - Described `bp_lo` column; filled Null values , made heatmap, Correlate bp_lo and cardio, Use scaling technique
  - Data Exploration on height and weight column( convert cm to m to calculate BMI), visualization on weight distribution, correlation of height, weight, BMI, and cardio, correlation with map
  - Data Exploration on the active column. Correlate with the target variable, Visualize active distribution, and Find correlation using the heatmap
  - Cleaned Data for Train/Test Data Split. Data description of `chol`,`gluc`, and `diabetic` columns; Co-related Data; Used OHE() to distribute categorical values into binary for target variable; Plotted individual frequency distributions charts for visualizing Balance in data; Researched sklearn

- LEARNED PANDAS LIBRARY
- SPLIT TEST AND TRAINING DATA
- EXPLORED MATPLOT LIBRARY
- DOCUMENTED PROJECT REPORT AND WEEKLY TASKS
