## Working on Branch

- When working on new task/feature, create a new branch then work on that branch. format of the branch `git branch <your_name-task/feature>`
  - e.g. `git checkout -b prakash/data-cleaning-age`
- Developer always have to pull `git pull` code from `main` branch and sync with it.
- Make a PR(Pull Request) after completion of task/feature and always add a code reviewer in associated PR.
- Make a habit to check on your PR, so that you can follow along with status, comments, tasks of your PR.
- Once your PR is approved and merged to main branch then you can switch back to main branch and ready to work on another feature/task.

```bash
git branch # to list branch
git checkout -b <branch_name> # create new branch and move to new branch
git checkout <branch_name> # to change branch

git add . # to add your changes
git commit -m "your commit message" # to commit your changes
